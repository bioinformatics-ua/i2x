# What is i2x?

**i2x** is a data integration framework, targeting the automated real-time integration of data from heterogeneous resources to multiple destinations. **i2x** provides pure Integration-as-a-Service, acting as an _intelligent ETL proxy_ between distinct services.

<hr>

# How does i2x work?

**i2x** relies on distributed agents to monitor custom content changes. When new changes are detected, **i2x** generates a new [Event][] and triggers the execution of any number of [templates][] associated with the starting [agent][] (through integrations).

<hr>

# What are agents?

[Agents][] are intelligent algorithms that monitor configured data sources, detecting changes to their content. [Agents][] can run on **i2x**'s' server or locally, in a truly distributed environment.

<hr>

# What are templates?

[Templates][] are used to define what to do data with the data points gathered by the [agents][]. This can go from updating a file in your Dropbox account to sending custom emails.

<hr>

# What are integrations?

Putting it simply, [Integrations][] connect [agents][] with [templates][]. Hence, [integrations][] are the logical bridge between the distributed monitored [sources][] and the actions triggered by content changes.
